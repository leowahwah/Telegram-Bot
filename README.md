# Telegram-Bot
This telegram bot aims to cheer up my friend who is currently lost in the relationship with his girlfriend, named akon, by making some stupid responses imitating her. 

The simple bot is able to reply to messages containing specific keywords.

To create such Telegram bot, you first need to find Bot Father on Telegram and type /start.

Name your bot and an API token will be given to you by Bot Father.

You may want to keep the token secret as anyone can alter your bot with the token.

Copy the code in your IDE and have fun!

Once the bot is created you may want to have it added into your Telegram groups. However, it may not respond to group messages.

To solve this, go to Bot Father again.

type /setprivacy then Disable.

And the problem shall be addressed.
